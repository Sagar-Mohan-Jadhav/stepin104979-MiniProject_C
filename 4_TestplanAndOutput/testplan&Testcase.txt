TEST PLAN:

In this project, errors can be injected at any stage during development.
There are various techniques for detecting and eliminating errors that originate in that phase.
It is particularly true because in the earlier phases and most of the verification techniques are manual because no executable code exists.
Ultimately those remaining errors will be reflected in the code.
Hence, the code developed during the coding activity is likely to have some requirement errors and design errors, in addition to errors introduced during the coding activity.
Behaviour can be observed, testing is the phase where the errors remaining from all the previous phases must be detected.
Hence, testing performs a very critical role in assurance and for ensuring the reliability of the software.

TEST CASE:


Different functions are used for performing different billing operations in the warehouse billing system such as:
•	void input()
•	void writefile()
•	void search()
•	void output()

•	The function void input() is used to add the new customer account i.e. with the help of this functions the parameters such as name, address, phone number, amount paid etc.
are asked and entered.

•	The function void writefile() has been utilized to create a file on hard disc of computer for storing the information and data of a customer.
•	The function void search() has been used to look for previously stored accounts either by name or by number of the customer. 
•	The fourth and the last user defined function used in this Warehouse Billing System is void output() which has been defined to show the result as console output.
